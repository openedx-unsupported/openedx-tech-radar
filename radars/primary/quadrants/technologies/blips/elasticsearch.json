  "description": "A full-text search engine used for search functionality in several Open edX services.  Recently the subject of a licensing spat between the developers and Amazon, it is currently still the market-dominant open source search engine.  Open edX primarily uses the latest version compatible with Amazon's hosted offering, although edx.org doesn't currently utilize that offering."
