  "description": "<a href=\"https://www.attrs.org/\">attrs</a> is a Python library for writing classes with minimal boilerplate.  It inspired the dataclasses module in the Python standard library, but is more full-featured.  Attrs is widely considered the best-practice library for minimal-boilerplate classes.\nAttrs is best to use when a class is a passive container of data, but is also a good foundation to build on for active mutable objects."
