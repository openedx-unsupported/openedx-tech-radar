  "description": "ADRs are local lightweight documents of technical decisions co-located with its corresponding code. They are much easier to maintain than traditional design documents since they are a running log of decisions without the need to update old decisions.</br></br>They allow developers to understand the rationale behind the code and the archeological path to its current state. These records prove to be an <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records\">invaluable technique</a> for engineering teams to onboard new members, to understand discovered historical traces, to refer back to past decisions, and to support external oversight. See <a href=\"https://github.com/edx/open-edx-proposals/pull/74/\">OEP-19: Developer Docs</a> for more information.</br></br>See 'Blip: OEPs' as an alternative process for documenting technical decisions that have system-wide impact."
