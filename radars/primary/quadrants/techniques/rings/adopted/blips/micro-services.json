  "description": "Using a collection of business and organization aligned smaller services, each dedicated to a specific functionality domain, rather than one monolithic service for an entire site.  Open edX started as a monolithic service but has started implementing more and more functionality in new micro-services to accelerate development and improve maintainability as the platform grows. When defining micro-services, ensure services are not <i>too</i> small, which can lead to a 'distributed monolith'. See `Blip: Boundaries (domain driven)`."
