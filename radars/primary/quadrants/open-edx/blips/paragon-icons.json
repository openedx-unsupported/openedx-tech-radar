  "description": "Blip: Paragon contains a library of SVG icons for use in frontends, based on MUI icons.  We prefer the use of these icons over font-awesome or other icon libraries, and are actively investing in adding icons for all of our use cases.  We originally created this library because font-awesome didn't have some icons we needed, and have since started switching over to it for consistency and to keep our bundle sizes down."
