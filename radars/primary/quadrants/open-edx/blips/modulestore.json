  "description": "<a href=\"https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/tree/master/common/lib/xmodule/xmodule/modulestore\">Modulestore</a> is an Open edX code abstraction which is part of edx-platform. It stores and retrieves course module content to/from MongoDB and MySQL, while adding other stateful and stateless to the module. The Open edX platform has gone through three iterations of the modulestore - XML-based, \"Old Mongo\", and the current \"Split Mongo\" implementation. The modulestore is also shared by Studio and the LMS, though it is known to be non-performant. The Open edX platform is moving in the direction of using the modulestore in Studio only, while using a more performant, non-modulestore data model/interface for the LMS.\n"
