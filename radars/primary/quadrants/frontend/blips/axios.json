  "description": "Promise-based HTTP client to make asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints to perform CRUD operations.  This library is used as the basis for the 'auth' module in Blip: frontend-platform and handles all our API communication between micro-frontends and our backend services.  We use its concept of \"interceptors\" to add request and response handling.  Axios is an integral part of our micro-frontend platform today, and we plan to continue to use it."
