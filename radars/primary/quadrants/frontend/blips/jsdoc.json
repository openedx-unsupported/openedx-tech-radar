  "description": "JSDoc is a JavaScript documentation tool and standard for writing docstrings for modules, objects, and functions.  Some of our libraries model their documentation structure on JSDoc.  Notably, Blip: frontend-platform generates its documentation site with JSDoc. Investigation hasn't found any other reasonable tools for JavaScript code comments."
