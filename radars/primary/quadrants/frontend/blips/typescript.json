  "description": "TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing to the language. TypeScript may require architectural support; however, it can be configured to allow migration on a file-by-file basis rather than converting to the new paradigm all at once. Some providers in the community are known to favor TypeScript. We recommend that component maintainers consider using TypeScript where static typing is most valuable (e.g., JS libaries, data model layer), rather than opting to refactor all existing JavaScript to TypeScript unless there is demonstrated value in doing so."
