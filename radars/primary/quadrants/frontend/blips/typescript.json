  "description": "TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing to the language. TypeScript requires architectural support and that all associated code is updated to the new paradigm, which can be costly.  Some providers in the community favor TypeScript, but we do not currently use it, and have no plans to start.  For consistency and the approachability of our codebase, we'd recommend using ES6 unless there is a very compelling reason to adopt TypeScript."
